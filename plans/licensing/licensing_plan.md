# WMS Backend Licensing System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a device-based licensing system for the on-premise WMS backend that communicates with a cloud license server for monthly billing and account management.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Device Management System** - Track and manage registered devices
2. **Account Status Management** - Handle account lifecycle and payment states
3. **Cloud License Server Integration** - Communicate with external licensing service
4. **License Cache & Validation** - Local storage and validation of license data
5. **Access Control Middleware** - Enforce licensing restrictions on API endpoints
6. **Background Services** - Handle cloud synchronization and validation

### Device Lifecycle
```
Registration → Active → PaymentDue → PaymentDueUnknown → Disabled
                ↓
              Demo → Active (on payment) or DemoExpired
```

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is broken down into 4 logical phases to ensure incremental delivery and testing:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Device Management
- Database schema and context
- Device registration and management
- Basic API endpoints for device operations

### Phase 2: Account Status & License Cache
- Account status management system
- License data caching and encryption
- Status transition logic

### Phase 3: Cloud Integration & Synchronization
- Cloud license server communication
- Background service for sync operations
- Retry and queue mechanisms

### Phase 4: Access Control & Middleware
- License validation middleware
- API endpoint restrictions
- Authentication integration

## Technical Requirements

### Database Requirements
- New `LicenseDbContext` for device and license data
- Encrypted storage for sensitive license information
- Audit trail for device status changes

### API Requirements
- Device Controller with superuser-only access
- License validation endpoints
- Integration with existing authentication system

### Background Services
- Cloud synchronization service
- Daily validation tasks
- Retry queue processing

### Security Requirements
- Bearer token authentication with IP locking
- Encrypted license data storage
- Secure device UUID handling

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Cloud license server (to be implemented separately)
- Frontend device UUID generation (localStorage)

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing authentication system
- Current database context and migrations
- API middleware pipeline

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Device management operations
- Account status transitions
- License validation logic
- Encryption/decryption operations

### Integration Testing
- Cloud server communication
- Database operations
- Middleware integration
- Background service operations

### Mock Testing
- Mock cloud server using C# .csx file
- Simulated network failures
- Various account status scenarios

## Risk Mitigation

### Network Connectivity
- Queue failed requests for retry
- Graceful degradation when cloud unreachable
- Local cache validation as fallback

### Data Integrity
- Encrypted license data storage
- Audit trail for all status changes
- Atomic operations for critical updates

### Performance
- Efficient caching mechanisms
- Optimized database queries
- Background processing for non-critical operations

## Deliverables

1. **Phase Implementation Documents** - Detailed technical specifications for each phase
2. **Database Schemas** - Complete entity definitions and relationships
3. **API Contracts** - OpenAPI specifications for all endpoints
4. **Testing Plans** - Comprehensive test scenarios and acceptance criteria
5. **Deployment Guide** - Configuration and setup instructions

## Success Criteria

- All devices properly registered and tracked
- Account status transitions work correctly
- Cloud communication reliable with proper retry mechanisms
- Access control enforced based on license status
- System maintains functionality during network outages
- Complete audit trail of all licensing operations
