# Package/Box Management System - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of a package/box management system for the WMS. The system allows creating mixed inventory containers during operations while maintaining full traceability and integration with existing SAP backend systems.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
- **WMS-Only Entity**: Packages exist only in WMS, not in SAP
- **Location Synchronization**: Package location always matches content location
- **Operation Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Goods Receipt, Counting, Transfer, and Picking workflows
- **Full Traceability**: Complete audit trail for package contents and movements
- **Configurable Features**: Customer-specific settings and customizations

## Implementation Phases

This implementation is divided into 6 phases, each documented in separate files:

### [Phase 1: Database Schema & Core Entities](./packages_plan_phase1.md)
- Package, PackageContent, PackageTransaction, and PackageLocationHistory entities
- Database constraints, triggers, and Entity Framework configuration
- Migration scripts and indexing strategy
- **Timeline**: Week 1-2

### [Phase 2: Package Management Services & API](./packages_plan_phase2.md)
- Core package service implementation with full CRUD operations
- Package controller with comprehensive REST API
- Barcode generation system with configurable format
- Request/response models and validation
- **Timeline**: Week 3-4

### [Phase 3: Operation Integration](./packages_plan_phase3.md)
- Goods Receipt integration with package toggle functionality
- Counting integration with package scanning capability
- Transfer integration with package movement rules
- Picking integration with forced package scanning logic
- **Timeline**: Week 5-7

### [Phase 4: Validation & Consistency Management](./packages_plan_phase4.md)
- SAP consistency validation service with comprehensive checks
- Background validation service with configurable scheduling
- Real-time validation for critical operations
- Inconsistency management and resolution workflow
- **Timeline**: Week 8-9

### [Phase 5: Reports & Label System](./packages_plan_phase5.md)
- Comprehensive package reporting system
- Configurable label generation with multiple formats
- Export capabilities (Excel, CSV, PDF)
- Print integration with existing printer infrastructure
- **Timeline**: Week 10-11

### [Phase 6: Configuration System & Final Integration](./packages_plan_phase6.md)
- Complete configuration system with validation
- Custom attributes system with business rule validation
- External system integration via webhooks
- Final testing and deployment preparation
- **Timeline**: Week 12

## Quick Reference

### Key Features Overview
- **Per-operation package toggle**: Users can start package mode for each operation
- **Package states**: Init → Active → Closed/Cancelled/Locked lifecycle
- **Location consistency**: All operations enforce package/content location synchronization
- **Business rules enforcement**: Configurable validation and constraints
- **SAP integration**: Consistency validation with hybrid approach (real-time + scheduled)
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Multiple report types with export capabilities
- **Configurable labels**: Custom templates with barcode generation

### Configuration Highlights
```json
{
  "Options": {
    "enablePackages": true
  },
  "Package": {
    "Barcode": {
      "Prefix": "PKG",
      "Length": 14,
      "Suffix": ""
    },
    "Validation": {
      "IntervalMinutes": 30,
      "EnableRealTimeValidation": true,
      "AutoLockInconsistentPackages": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Package Workflow Summary
1. **Creation**: User toggles package mode during operation
2. **Building**: Items scanned are added to active package
3. **Completion**: Package closed and optionally labeled
4. **Operations**: Package can be moved, picked from, or transferred
5. **Validation**: Continuous consistency checking with SAP
6. **Reporting**: Comprehensive tracking and audit capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Review each phase document for detailed implementation specifications
2. Set up development environment with required dependencies
3. Begin with Phase 1 database schema implementation
4. Follow sequential phase implementation for best results
5. Test thoroughly at each phase before proceeding
