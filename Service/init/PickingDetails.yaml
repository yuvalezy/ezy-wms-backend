# Installation Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to ../config/PickingDetails.yaml
# 2. Add specific picking detail fields as required by your warehouse operations
# 3. Configure Query and GroupBy properties for dynamic data retrieval
# 4. Ensure database permissions for custom field queries
# 5. Test field integration with picking workflow
# 6. Coordinate with CustomFields.yaml to avoid field conflicts

# Field Properties Documentation:
# - Id: Unique identifier for the picking detail field (required string)
# - Description: Human-readable label for picker UI (required string)
# - Query: SQL query to retrieve field data (optional string, JsonIgnore)
# - GroupBy: SQL grouping expression for data organization (optional string, JsonIgnore)

# Integration Notes:
# - PickingDetails uses the same CustomField[] structure as CustomFields
# - Query and GroupBy properties are ignored during JSON serialization
# - Fields integrate with the main picking workflow and UI
# - Empty array is valid and represents no custom picking fields
# - Consider picker device screen size when adding fields
