# Configuration Notes:
# - This file is mandatory and must be present for system operation
# - All enum values are case-sensitive and must match exactly
# - SQL filter clauses should be properly escaped for your database type
# - Warehouse codes must match existing warehouse definitions in SAP B1
# - Bin entry IDs must correspond to valid bin locations in the warehouse
# - ServerType values depend on your SAP B1 database server version
# - Service Layer URL is only required when using SboServiceLayer adapter
# - Test all SQL filter queries before deploying to production
# - Backup existing configurations before making changes
