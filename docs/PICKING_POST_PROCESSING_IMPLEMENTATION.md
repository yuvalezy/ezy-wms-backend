# Picking Post-Processing System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a plugin-based post-processing system that executes custom business logic after PickingUpdate operations complete successfully. This system allows customers to add specific functionality without modifying core application code.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **IPickingPostProcessor Interface** (`Core/Interfaces/IPickingPostProcessor.cs`)
   - Defines the contract for all post-processors
   - Includes `ExecuteAsync()` method for custom logic
   - Includes `IsEnabled()` method for configuration-based control

2. **PickingPostProcessorContext** (`Core/Models/PickingPostProcessorContext.cs`)
   - Provides context data to processors including:
     - AbsEntry and processed pick list data
     - Configuration dictionary for processor-specific settings
     - ServiceProvider for dependency injection access
     - Logger for structured logging

3. **PickingPostProcessorFactory** (`Infrastructure/Services/PickingPostProcessorFactory.cs`)
   - Loads and manages post-processor instances
   - Supports dynamic assembly loading from external DLLs
   - Handles configuration and enablement logic
   - Uses lazy loading for performance

4. **Integration Point** (`Infrastructure/Services/PickListProcessService.cs`)
   - Hooks post-processors after successful picking operations
   - Executes all enabled processors sequentially
   - Handles failures gracefully without breaking main flow

### Configuration System

Added `PickingPostProcessingSettings` to the configuration system:
- Supports multiple processors per installation
- Each processor can be individually enabled/disabled
- Processor-specific configuration through JSON
- Assembly and type name specification for dynamic loading

## Implementation Details

### Hook Integration

The post-processing hook is integrated in `PickListProcessService.ProcessPickList()` after:
1. SAP Business One picking operation completes successfully
2. Pick list status is updated to `Synced`
3. Before the success response is returned

This ensures post-processing only runs on successful operations and doesn't interfere with error handling.

### Service Registration

Post-processor factory is registered as a singleton in the DI container (`Service/Configuration/DependencyInjectionConfig.cs`) to:
- Load assemblies once during application startup
- Cache processor instances for better performance
- Share configuration across all processing requests

### Error Handling

- Individual processor failures don't affect other processors
- Post-processing failures don't break the main picking operation
- All errors are logged with structured data for troubleshooting
- Processors can implement their own retry logic if needed

## Customer Example Implementation

Created `Customer.Extensions` project demonstrating the specific requirements:

### PackagingCalculatorPostProcessor

Implements the exact customer requirement:

1. **Query EF Database** - Retrieves picking data with package barcodes:
   ```sql
   select T0."PickEntry", ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...) RowNumber, 
          T0."ItemCode", T0."Quantity", T2."Barcode"
   from "PickLists" T0
   left outer join "PackageCommitments" T1 on T1."SourceOperationId" = T0."Id"
   left outer join "Packages" T2 on T2."Id" = T1."PackageId"
   where T0."AbsEntry" = @AbsEntry
   ```

2. **Execute Complex CTE** - Runs packaging calculations in SAP database:
   ```sql
   WITH src AS (SELECT * FROM (VALUES ...))
   -- Complex CTE with packaging logic
   -- Calculates packs for non-packaged and packaged items
   -- Generates barcode sequences for packaging
   ```

3. **Update SAP Orders** - Uses Service Layer to update SerialNum and PackQty:
   ```csharp
   await sboCompany.PatchAsync($"Orders({orderEntry})/Lines({lineNum})", 
       new { SerialNum = barcode, PackQty = packs });
   ```

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "PickingPostProcessing": {
    "Processors": [
      {
        "Id": "customer-packaging-calculator",
        "Assembly": "Customer.Extensions.dll",
        "TypeName": "Customer.Extensions.PackagingCalculatorPostProcessor",
        "Enabled": true,
        "Configuration": {
          "Enabled": true,
          "BatchSize": 100,
          "TimeoutSeconds": 30
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Deployment Instructions

### For Core System
1. Core changes are part of the main application
2. No additional deployment steps required
3. Empty processor list by default (no impact on existing operations)

### For Customer Extensions
1. Build `Customer.Extensions.dll` with customer-specific logic
2. Copy DLL to main application directory (alongside `Service.exe`)
3. Update `appsettings.json` with processor configuration
4. Restart service to load processors

## Key Benefits

1. **Non-Breaking** - Existing operations continue unchanged
2. **Isolated** - Customer code runs in separate assemblies
3. **Configurable** - Enable/disable without code changes
4. **Testable** - Processors can be unit tested independently
5. **Scalable** - Support for multiple processors per customer
6. **Observable** - Comprehensive logging throughout execution

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Lazy loading of processors minimizes startup impact
- Processors run sequentially to avoid concurrency issues
- ServiceProvider scoping ensures proper resource cleanup

### Security
- Assembly loading restricted to configured paths
- Type validation ensures only valid processors are loaded
- Configuration validation prevents invalid assemblies

### Maintainability
- Clear separation between core system and customer code
- Well-defined interfaces for future extensibility
- Comprehensive documentation and examples provided

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
1. **Parallel Execution** - Run independent processors concurrently
2. **Conditional Processing** - Skip processors based on pick list properties
3. **Configuration UI** - Web-based processor management
4. **Health Checks** - Monitor processor health and performance
5. **Version Management** - Support for processor versioning and updates

## Testing

All components compile successfully:
- ✅ Core interfaces and models
- ✅ Infrastructure factory and services
- ✅ Service dependency injection
- ✅ Customer.Extensions sample implementation

The system is ready for deployment and customer-specific implementations.
