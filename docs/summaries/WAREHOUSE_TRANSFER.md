# Warehouse-to-Warehouse Transfer Approval Workflow

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a comprehensive cross-warehouse transfer approval workflow system that allows users to transfer inventory between warehouses with supervisor approval for non-supervisor users.

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Production Ready

---

## Feature Summary

The warehouse-to-warehouse transfer approval workflow enables:

1. **Cross-Warehouse Transfers** - Users can select a target warehouse different from their current warehouse
2. **Approval Workflow** - Non-supervisor users must request approval for cross-warehouse transfers
3. **Real-Time Notifications** - SignalR-powered instant notifications for approval requests and responses
4. **Bidirectional Communication** - Both approval requests and responses trigger notifications
5. **WMS Alert System** - Internal notification system separate from external ERP alerts
6. **Configuration Toggle** - Feature can be enabled/disabled via configuration

---

## Workflow Details

### 1. Creating a Cross-Warehouse Transfer

**User Action:**
1. User navigates to Transfer form
2. Selects a target warehouse different from current warehouse
3. Creates transfer document

**System Behavior:**
- Transfer is created with `TargetWhsCode` set
- Status remains `Open` initially
- Transfer can be processed normally

### 2. Processing Cross-Warehouse Transfer (Non-Supervisor)

**User Action:**
1. Non-supervisor user processes a cross-warehouse transfer

**System Behavior:**
1. Backend checks if `EnableWarehouseTransfer` is enabled
2. Detects cross-warehouse transfer (`TargetWhsCode ≠ WhsCode`)
3. Verifies user is not a supervisor
4. Changes status to `WaitingForApproval`
5. Retrieves all supervisors for the source warehouse
6. Creates `WmsAlert` for each supervisor with:
   - Type: `TransferApprovalRequest`
   - Message: "{User} has requested approval for transfer #{Number}"
   - Action URL: `/transfer/approve/{Id}`
7. Sends real-time notification via SignalR to all supervisors
8. Returns success message: "Transfer submitted for approval"

**Frontend Behavior:**
1. Displays orange approval pending card
2. Shows source and target warehouse information
3. Disables scanning inputs and finish button
4. User waits for supervisor approval

### 3. Supervisor Receives Notification

**System Behavior:**
1. SignalR sends "ReceiveAlert" event to supervisor's connected client
2. NotificationBell component displays badge with unread count
3. Supervisor sees alert in dropdown with yellow warning icon
4. Alert shows: "{User} has requested approval for transfer #{Number}"

### 4. Supervisor Approves Transfer

**Supervisor Action:**
1. Clicks on alert (navigates to approval page)
2. Reviews transfer details
3. Clicks "Approve" button

**System Behavior:**
1. Backend receives `POST /api/transfer/approve` with `Approved = true`
2. Verifies supervisor has `TransferSupervisor` role
3. Changes transfer status from `WaitingForApproval` to `InProgress`
4. Marks all approval request alerts as read
5. Calls `ProcessTransfer` method to complete the transfer
6. Creates `WmsAlert` for requester with:
   - Type: `TransferApproved`
   - Message: "Your transfer request #{Number} has been approved by {Supervisor}"
   - Action URL: `/transfer/process/{Id}`
7. Sends real-time notification to requester via SignalR
8. Returns transfer processing result

**Requester Notification:**
1. Receives green success notification
2. Can now continue with the approved transfer

### 5. Supervisor Rejects Transfer

**Supervisor Action:**
1. Clicks "Reject" button
2. Optionally enters rejection reason

**System Behavior:**
1. Backend receives `POST /api/transfer/approve` with `Approved = false`
2. Changes transfer status to `Cancelled`
3. Closes all open transfer lines
4. Marks all approval request alerts as read
5. Creates `WmsAlert` for requester with:
   - Type: `TransferRejected`
   - Message: "Your transfer request #{Number} has been rejected by {Supervisor}. Reason: {Reason}"
   - Action URL: `/transfer/{Id}`
6. Sends real-time notification to requester via SignalR
7. Returns rejection message

**Requester Notification:**
1. Receives red rejection notification with reason
2. Transfer is cancelled and cannot be processed

## Configuration

### Backend Configuration

**File:** `Service/config/Configurations.yaml`

```yaml
# Transfer Configuration
# Whether to enable cross-warehouse transfers with approval workflow (bool, default: false)
# When enabled, users can transfer items between warehouses
# Non-supervisor users will require supervisor approval for cross-warehouse transfers
EnableWarehouseTransfer: false
```

**Options Class:** `Core/Models/Settings/Options.cs`
```csharp
public bool EnableWarehouseTransfer { get; init; }
```

### Frontend Configuration

The feature availability is exposed through the `ApplicationSettings` interface:
```typescript
interface ApplicationSettings {
  // ... other settings
  enableWarehouseTransfer: boolean;
}
```

This is automatically populated from backend settings when user logs in.

GET /api/wmsalert?unreadOnly=true&limit=10
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response: 200 OK
[
  {
    "id": "guid",
    "userId": "guid",

---

## SignalR Integration

### Hub Endpoint
```
wss://your-domain.com/hubs/notifications
```

### Authentication
SignalR uses the same JWT token as REST API. The token is sent via query string or headers.

### Events

#### Server → Client Events

**ReceiveAlert**
```typescript
connection.on("ReceiveAlert", (alert: WmsAlertResponse) => {
  console.log("New alert received:", alert);
  // Update UI, show notification, etc.
});
```

**UnreadCountUpdate**
```typescript
connection.on("UnreadCountUpdate", (count: number) => {
  console.log("Unread count updated:", count);
  // Update badge count
});
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
const connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
  .withUrl(`${API_BASE_URL}/hubs/notifications`, {
    accessTokenFactory: () => token,
  })
  .withAutomaticReconnect()
  .build();

await connection.start();
```

## Security Considerations

### Authorization

1. **API Endpoints**: All WmsAlert endpoints require `[Authorize]` attribute
2. **Transfer Approval**: Requires `TransferSupervisor` role or `SuperUser` flag
3. **User Isolation**: Users can only see their own alerts
4. **SignalR**: Authenticated connections only, user identification via JWT

### Validation

1. **Transfer Status**: Can only approve transfers in `WaitingForApproval` status
2. **Ownership**: Alerts can only be marked as read by their owner
3. **Role Verification**: Supervisor role is verified server-side before approval
4. **Warehouse Access**: Supervisors must have access to the source warehouse

### Data Protection

1. **Audit Trail**: All alerts have full audit trail (Created/Updated by/at)
2. **Soft Delete**: Alerts support soft delete for data retention
3. **Nullable Fields**: CreatedByUserId is nullable to handle system-generated entities

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes

Three indexes optimize WmsAlert queries:
1. `(UserId, IsRead)` - Fast unread alert queries
2. `ObjectId` - Quick object-based lookups
3. `CreatedAt` - Efficient time-based ordering

### SignalR Connection Management

1. Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
2. Connection only established when user is authenticated
3. Clean disconnect on logout
4. Shared connection for all notification features

### Frontend Optimization

1. Only last 10 alerts loaded in dropdown
2. Unread count cached in context
3. Optimistic UI updates for mark as read
4. Efficient re-renders using React Context

## Troubleshooting

### SignalR Connection Issues

**Problem:** Notifications not received in real-time

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for SignalR connection errors
2. Verify WebSocket support: `chrome://inspect/#devices`
3. Check JWT token is valid and not expired
4. Verify firewall allows WebSocket connections
5. Check SignalR hub endpoint: `GET /hubs/notifications`

### Alert Not Created

**Problem:** Supervisor not receiving approval request notification

**Solutions:**
1. Verify supervisor has `TransferSupervisor` role
2. Check supervisor has access to source warehouse
3. Verify `EnableWarehouseTransfer` is true
4. Check database for WmsAlert records
5. Review server logs for errors

### Transfer Stuck in WaitingForApproval

**Problem:** Transfer cannot be approved or processed

**Solutions:**
1. Check if approving user has supervisor role
2. Verify transfer status is exactly `WaitingForApproval`
3. Use SQL to manually update status if needed:
   ```sql
   UPDATE Transfers
   SET Status = 1 -- InProgress
   WHERE Id = 'guid';
   ```
